CCT Mobile Dev - CA2
Student: Mattia Bergamini

Lecturer: Mikhail Timofeev

This is a CA (continuous assessment work) that I completed for the 'Mobile Dev' module, part of the Computer Science lvl 8 course at CCT College.
The task was to build an Ionic application that could consume Breaking Bad API https://breakingbadapi.com and display the data in 4 tabs â€“ Characters, Episodes, Quotes, Death Count.
